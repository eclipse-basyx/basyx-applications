# AAS TimeSeries

This example includes a demo for the time series data plugin. It is designed to to be used with the time series data submodel template specified by the IDTA. The specification can be found [here](https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IDTA-02008-1-1_Submodel_TimeSeriesData.pdf).

The plugin supports the following segment types:

- **InternalSegment**: This segment defines time series data within the AAS
- **ExternalSegment**: This segment defines time series data inside a file or blob SubmodelElement (the example includes a csv file as an example)
- **LinkedSegment**: This segment defines time series data inside a linked time series database (the example includes an InfluxDB together with telegraf for mqtt as an example)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker

### Installing

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` in this directory

You can now access the AAS Web UI (http://localhost:3000) and InfluxDB UI (http://localhost:8086) in your browser.
The username and password for InfluxDB are `admin` and `testtest`.

## Usage

### Internal Segment

1. Open the AAS Web UI in your browser (http://localhost:3000)
2. Select the `TimeSeriesDemo` AAS and click on the `TimeSeriesTest` submodel in the treeview
3. In the `Visualization`-window select the `InternalSegment` in the Segment dropdown
4. Select `time` as time-value and `speed` as y-value
5. Click on `Fetch Data`
6. In the `Preview Chart`-window select a chart type
7. You should now see a chart with the time series data

### External Segment

1. Open the AAS Web UI in your browser (http://localhost:3000)
2. Select the `TimeSeriesDemo` AAS and click on the `TimeSeriesTest` submodel in the treeview
3. In the `Visualization`-window select the `ExternalSegment` in the Segment dropdown
4. Select `time` as time-value and `speed` and `temperature` as y-values
5. Click on `Fetch Data`
6. In the `Preview Chart`-window select a chart type
7. You should now see a chart with the time series data

### Linked Segment

Prerequisites:

Check if the query property of the `LinkedSegment` corrosponds to the data you want to fetch from the database. If not, change the query property to the desired query (see images below).

![AAS Web UI query property](../../Docs/Figs//AAS_UI_TimeSeriesConfig.png)

1. Open the AAS Web UI in your browser (http://localhost:3000)
2. Select the `TimeSeriesDemo` AAS and click on the `TimeSeriesTest` submodel in the treeview
3. In the `Visualization`-window select the `LinkedSegment` in the Segment dropdown
4. Select `time` as time-value and `speed` and `temperature` as y-values
5. Enter the following API-Token for the InfluxDB: `noyBokO69-nLzsjhnE4gx53TVkRc7QzFe6IUPkvkNIk9ynjl2zMcoO_wKkeMda8FBVaMElHBnIz7BcPLu5lL3g==`
6. Click on `Fetch Data`
7. In the `Preview Chart`-window select a chart type
8. You should now see a chart with the time series data

You can always press the `Fetch Data` button again to update the chart with the latest data from the database.

## Visualization Options

You can choose between the following chart types:

- Line Chart
- Area Chart
- Scatter Chart
- Histogram
- Gauge

For most of the chart types you can also alter some options. Those include:

- Time Range
- Interpolation Mode
- Number of Bins (for Histogram)
- If Bars should be stacked (for Histogram)

## Disclaimer

- The LinkedSegment was only tested with InfluxDB
- The ExternalSegment was only tested with csv files (RFC 4180 with header line) in a file SubmodelElement
