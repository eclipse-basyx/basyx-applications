# AAS Dashboard for Industry 4.0

## Overview

The Dashboard API is a RESTful service that provides a backend for the AAS Web UI's Dashboard feature. It enables users to create, view and manage widgets for monitoring and controlling assets in an Industry 4.0 environment. The API is built using Spring Boot and is available as on off-the-shelf component from our Dockerhub repository.
